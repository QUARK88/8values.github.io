<h2>What is CapacValues ?</h2>
    <p>CapacValues is a test to see how much you align with capacitationism, the ideology of Solar#5896.</p>

<h2>What are the eight values ?</h2>
    <p>There are four independent axes - Luxury, Worker, Progress and Personal - and each has two opposing values assigned to them :</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff6b7b;">Opulence</b> ( Luxury )<br/>
        Those with higher Opulence scores believe the economy should follow individual demand. They tend to support consumerism, markets and oppose paternalistic taxes.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7178ec;">Sustenance</b> ( Luxury )<br/>
        Those with higher Sustenance scores believe the economy should provide basic needs first. They tend to support economic planning, welfare and oppose indulgence.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#e00041;">Proportion</b> ( Worker )<br/>
        Those with higher Proportion scores believe that workers should be payed proportionately to the wealth they create. They tend to support socialism and unions, and oppose profits made without contributing.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffe525;">Exploitation</b> ( Worker )<br/>
        Those with higher Exploitation scores believe that proportional inequality is justified. They tend to support absolute property rights, class systems and oppose economic reform.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#73c6a8;">Advancement</b> ( Progress )<br/>
        Those with higher Advancement scores see no value in preserving the past or present. They tend to support technological and social progress and oppose superstition and the preservation of customs.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff4d09;">Tradition</b> ( Progress )<br/>
        Those with higher Tradition scores believe that the authenticity of the past should be preserved. They tend to believe that nature, tradition and culture have inherent value.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ffa755;">Autonomy</b> ( Personal )<br/>
        Those with higher Autonomy scores believe that the individual is capable of deciding what to do with their own body. They tend to support drug decriminalisation, civil liberties and oppose restrictions on the individual.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#b15bff;">Control</b> ( Personal )<br/>
        Those with higher Control scores believe that the state or society as a whole is better at deciding what an individual should be allowed to do to themselves. They tend to support strict laws and social conformity.</p>
<h2>What is the " Closest Match " thing at the bottom of the results ?</h2>
    <p>Nothing, i didn't code that yet, too lazy ._.</h2>
